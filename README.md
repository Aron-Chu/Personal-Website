# Personal-Website

- In this project I deployed a website using Terraform to configure Cloudfront, ACM, and S3 resources. *Works on mobile 
- Containerized and created a pipeline using gitlab for continuous integration
- Added a contact functionality that utilizes Ajax to send a post request to a REST api that contains the name, email, and content to a dynamoDB table.
